# coding-exercises
Short coding exercises solved in Python 3.11 with the use of additional libraries specified in the requirements.txt.

### Exercise 1:

A simple python script that returns duplicates. No external libraries used. It is provided as a MVP.
No test cases were specified in the exercise, so I created a few lists that are fed into the function to test it.

### Exercise 2:

A standalone python package that returns the structure of a directory, given in the specified JSON format. 
Further documentation is located in the [exercise2](exercise2) folder as a README.md file.
The package is tested with pytest, tests are located in the [tests](exercise2/tests) folder.
